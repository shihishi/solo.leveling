            <p class="center-align red-text">Solo Leveling is a popular Webtoon featuring a ranking system for hunters authorized
               to clear and secure dungeons. <br>The main plot of Solo Leveling revolves around Sung Jin-Woo, once known as the "World's Weakest Hunter," <br>due to his immense weakness as a hunter. However, by chance, Jin-Woo discovers the System,<br>
               which allows him to level up, increasing his strength as a Hunter. <br>
               Once Jin-Woo reaches a certain level, the System grants him a Shadow Extraction skill, <br> permitting him to summon dead warriors' souls as powerful shadows. <br>
               Solo Leveling's protagonist then uses this power to create a powerful army, but some shadows stand out among his minions in terms of strength.</p>

            Jinwoo is a handsome and muscular young man with gray eyes, black hair, and sharp facial features. When using his powers or agitated, his eyes glow bright purple. He is almost always seen wearing dark colors, particularly black, and after slaughtering the Monarchs for a second time, takes to wearing a black glove on his left hand, which was severely scarred in his battle with Antares.

          <p class="red-text">
            Sung Jinwoo (성진우) is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, he got the chance of a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System, giving him the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint. As a result, by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him by the System, Jinwoo eventually rose to power as humanity's greatest hunter and the second Shadow Monarch. Back when he was weak, Jinwoo was a short, scrawny young man with hair long enough to completely cover his ears.

          <p class="red-text">
            Shadows (그림자) are a race of undead monsters that the Shadow Monarch can create from slain beasts and hunters using his Shadow Extraction skill. A shadow's level of personality depends on its grade. Normal to Elite Grade shadows have little to no personality at all, while Knight and Elite Knight Grade shadows are able to express simple emotions like anxiety and joy. In comparison, General and Marshal Grade Shadows have very developed personalities, as displayed by how Beru enjoyed watching Korean period dramas in his spare time and had his own unique style of speech.

            Beru (베르) is the shadow of the Ant King. Due to having been born to kill, Beru revels in his power and has an obvious bloodlust for battle. As such, he is very brutal in combat, rarely holding back unless ordered to, and goes straight for his enemy's weak spots. Beru is fiercely loyal to his master and has a lighter side of his personality, even complimenting him in a middle of a fight.

Igris is loyal, respectful, and chivalrous, to the point that he tends to kneel to his master every time he finishes a battle for him. A running gag with his character is that he always brings the head of his kills back to Jinwoo.

Tusk is obedient, quiet, and shy, as displayed when he sheepishly scratched the back of his head upon encountering a group of awed reporters during the Ahjin Guild's first dungeon raid. However he can also be competitive and a bit of a show-off, as displayed during his contest with the three dragons in Ashborn's shadow army.

                <p>I advise you to listen to rock or fighting tunes as you read it. I tried that as I was reading it, and the music made the fighting scenes more dramatic. It also gave me a really great sensation as I read it, and it affected my emotions since it was becoming more realistic. The smiling statue are a little terrifying but it's worth it!
